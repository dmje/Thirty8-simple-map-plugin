## Simple Map

A really simple "put things on a map" plugin

To make it work, do this:

1. Install as you would normally: download the zip, upload and activate
2. You should see "Map" appear in the admin menu
3. Before you can get started, you'll need a free Mapbox token - read about these and how to get one at [https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/how-mapbox-works/access-tokens/)
4. Paste this token into the Map Settings page
5. Add items to your map via Map > Add New Item to Map
6. To include the map on a page, use the [map] shortcode


**Note that this plugin comes with no guarantees! It has not been widely tested, and we recommend that you test on a staging version of your site and make sure you have a backup before installing!**
